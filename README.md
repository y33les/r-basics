_(There is also a non-interactive version on `nbviewer`
[here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/y33les/r-basics/blob/master/index.ipynb))_

This is an R tutorial originally written for my colleagues at [The
Centre for Education and Youth](https://cfey.org) that assumes zero
programming knowledge whatsoever.  It's probably riddled with
mistakes, but it should be enough to get you going.  Enjoy!
