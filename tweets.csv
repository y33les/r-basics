Recruiting activity in secondary schools down by about 50-60% compared to the same period last year https://gatsby.org.uk/uploads/educat,Never thought about this for parents. That is good!!
Main reason for drop is that schools are figuring out how to do online interviewing. So should pick up soon to some extent according to @TeacherTapp @schooldash,Congratulations Ed!
Economic uncertainty likey to reduce flows of teachers between jobs.,That's awesome!!
"pfff so tough. I thought my single mum friend with NHS job, 1 & 4 year olds in a flat with difficult landlord after her own flat burned down had it bad. But whole family not being able to go outside & the fear that must come with being immunosuppressed right now must be so hard.",Don’t tempt fate!!!!
I do mine whilst pruning and weeding in the garden (as I just did with @MatteoBergamini !) weirdly enough I find it easier to concentrate that way as don't get distracted by laptop screen / stuff on my desk etc,Well done @y33les !
"1. Sticking to weekly Mon pub night routine 2. Training (really) hard to lotsa banging drumnbass so I can return to climbing stronger than I left it 3.

“A third of teachers have been contacting specific parents to offer advice about supervised learning and a fifth say their school is providing pupils with laptops or other devices”.,"All children have the legal right to access education, but *as many as 1 million* cannot access online learning during lockdown.

Delighted to have you there :-),It sounds like such an intense time for schools in so many ways and you're going above and beyond! A massive thank you for everything you're doing to support your pupils and their families. Really hope the government provide more funding and support.

Given announcements on tech and Oak today it sounds to me unlikely that the May date is very high up their list of possible scenarios.,Thank you @MrNishKumar and the rest of the @MashReport gang for going ahead with the show from your own homes. #mashreport #COVIDー19
Can you say a bit more about some of the potential pitfalls to be wary of? Could be really handy,Marvellous.
Really glad to see some action on this - tech access is a key concern when it comes to supporting vulnerable young people through school closure.  ,hahaha! Thanks for sharing this tweet. Really made me chuckle!!
Well done for all the hard work!,Important reading for those working in #education and #youth re #COVID19 and #socialmobility.
Well it is- it’s about whether you blame the whole ethnic group that a person perpetrating a crime belongs to for it.,Amazing work @GoodLawProject @gem_abbott 
"This, from @KateBV explains why from a legal point of view, action is needed for ALL pupils who cannot access learning due to lack of technology https://cfey.org/2020/04/breaking-the-law-covid-19-and-online-learning/ @gem_abbott @GoodLawProject",Definitely would like to hear more!
